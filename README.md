# ResuBu
A Java application that generates Resumes


## Objective:
The objective of this project is to create a Java application that'll be able to import the users resume data from a text file and then with that data, allow users to generate multiple different types of resume with ease.

A simple example of this would be a person uploading there Education, Work Experience, Voluntering/Services and Accomplishments. Depending on the type of job that user is applying for they might no want to have everything showing. If it's for a low position job that you are trying to work until something better comes along... you might want to hide your education if it includes a high level degree like a Masters or PHD. If you have are applying for something technology related and there is something very distant from that area in your work experience, you'll probably want to just omit that from the resume as well. 

These are a few of the many different cases in which you'll want to tailor and format your resume for a job position. And ResuBu aims to give users that ability to speedily generate and print new resumes. Users will be able to decided on what they would like to show/hide on a resume for work experiences, descriptions (in case a user has multiple descriptions), Education, related courses, Voluntery services, accomplishments with different descriptions (in case a user has multiple accomplishments with/without links).

## Focus Group
This application is focused on myself and anyone like me who struggles with formatting their resume.
